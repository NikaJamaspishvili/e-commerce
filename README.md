## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes  

### **Free Plan Limitations:**  
- Both the hosting (**Vercel**) and database (**Aiven**) are on free plans.  
- The site might be slower than expected and could experience occasional downtime.  

### **Database Issues:**  
- If the site isn't working, it might be because the **Aiven free database** is down.  
- The free plan requires **manual backups**, so there might be delays in restoring functionality.  

### **No Real Payments:**  
- Since this is a hobby project, **there is no real payment integration**.  
- The "buy" functionality is simulated for demonstration purposes.

## üöÄ Development Journey  
This project was built **solo over the course of 1 month**.  

It was a significant learning experience, especially since I started with **zero knowledge of Next.js**. By the end of the project, I felt comfortable working with Next.js and gained a deeper understanding of full-stack development.
